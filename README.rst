Related projects
----------------

crispy-bulma's focus is on form handling. This project assumes that you have already integrated bulma into your project, either manually or using some other package. If crispy-bulma does not meet your needs maybe one of these projects is of interest to you:

* `django-bulma <https://github.com/timonweb/django-bulma>`__ - an alternative way to use bulma forms. Does not use crispy forms.

* `django-simple-bulma <https://github.com/lemonsaurus/django-simple-bulma>`__ - can be used together with this project. Provides bulma integration and ads support for bulma extensions.
