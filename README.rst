Requirements
------------

Officially supported versions:

* Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
* django-crispy-forms 1.12, 1.13, 1.14
* Bulma.css 0.9.4

**Note: Django 4.0 requires version 0.6.0+ and django-crispy-forms version 1.13+.**

Related projects
----------------

crispy-bulma's focus is on form handling. This project assumes that you have already integrated bulma into your project, either manually or using some other package. If crispy-bulma does not meet your needs maybe one of these projects is of interest to you:

* `django-bulma <https://github.com/timonweb/django-bulma>`__ - an alternative way to use bulma forms. Does not use crispy forms.

* `django-simple-bulma <https://github.com/lemonsaurus/django-simple-bulma>`__ - can be used together with this project. Provides bulma integration and ads support for bulma extensions.
